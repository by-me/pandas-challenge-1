# Pandas Data Analysis Challenge


## Description
This project is a module challenge centered on data analysis using Python's Pandas library. The main goal is to analyze a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company, exploring various aspects such as customer behavior, product popularity, and profitability. This hands-on experience enhances skills in examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting valuable insights from large datasets.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

# Part 1: Data Exploration

## Overview
This section involves exploring the dataset from a fictional e-commerce company using Python's Pandas library. The goal is to understand the data structure and identify key insights.

## Steps and Explanations

1. **View Column Names**: 
   - Used `df.columns` to display all column names in the dataset, providing an overview of available data attributes.

2. **Basic Statistics**:
   - The `df.describe()` method was applied to generate summary statistics for numerical columns, including counts, means, and standard deviations, which helps in understanding data distribution.

3. **Data Information**:
   - The `df.info()` method was utilized to display a concise summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts, aiding in identifying any missing data.

4. **Top Item Categories, Subcategories, and Clients**:
   - I employed the `value_counts()` method on the 'category', 'subcategory', and 'client_id' columns to count occurrences and identify the most popular item categories, subcategories, and the top five clients with the most entries.

5. **Store Client IDs**:
   - I extracted the top 5 client IDs into a list using the `tolist()` method, enabling easier reference for subsequent analyses.

6. **Total Units Ordered**:
   - To find out how many total units the client with the most entries ordered, I first used `idxmax()` to identify this client and then filtered the DataFrame to sum the 'qty' column for their orders.

>>In this part of the project, we successfully explored the dataset and identified key categories, subcategories, and clients. This foundational analysis sets the stage for more in-depth data transformation and analysis in subsequent parts of the project.



## Conclusion
This project enhanced my understanding of data exploration, transformation, and analysis using Pandas. I gained practical experience in manipulating datasets to extract useful business insights, preparing me for more complex data scenarios in the future.
